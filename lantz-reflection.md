**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I'm still not totally clear on the mechanics of pull requests.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Merge conflicts, as well as some more ins-and-outs of GitHub.


**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

Whether we should always be working in Git under a branch.  (the answer is YES)


**What still confuses you about Git?**

Still not quite clear what's going on in each step of the pull requests and still not totally sure how to fully use GitHub yet.


**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

I had both my first GPS and non-guided pairing sessions today and they both went very well.  My pairs were easy to get along with and I think we communicated well.  It's always a little strange connecting with strangers via the internet for the first time though.

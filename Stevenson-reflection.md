# Stevenson GPS 1.1 Reflections

    What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?


* I was still having some confusion over the specific steps to take when pushing files back to GitHub, and if pushing branches back to the GitHub remote copy was really okay. In my mind another logical option when dealing with branches was to merge them on my local directory, then send the master up. (Or merge them on my local directory, but then still send the branch to the remote GitHub site.)

    What concepts were clarified during the GPS?


* Being able to use the commands and proceedures in a somewhat 'real' environment helped a lot, but it was nice to have the guide there to act as a saftey net of sorts, and steer us back on track if we were drifting too far. Some additional small clarifications as we went along also really helped.

    What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?


* I asked for confirmations when typing code. I also asked the guide a question about pushing a local branch up to the GitHub account, which we pretty much covered in the GPS. I also asked where the Near North Neighborhood is in Chicago. I guess I bike through there all the time without realizing that area has its own name.

    What still confuses you about Git?


* One thing that came up in Release 5 is where images (and the direct link to them) are in a GitHub account. While my pair uploaded the screenshot to my GitHub repository, it seems terribly small. Nevermind, I just looked at the RAW image which was better.
* In this case our merge conflict was easy to make, and solve. However I don't think it will ever be that easy again. I am also currently looking for a command to list the various branches I have made (so I can clean them up).

    How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

* It was certainly a positive experience, and my pair was very easy to work with it seemed. I was happy my first pairing practice was the Guided Pairing Session, since it gave me an outline of what to expect in my other peer pairing sessions this week. As mentioned above, it was also helpful to have the guide with us, and I suspect she was a little more hands on than she said she usually is.
